    Welcome to the *Tour of Rust*. This is meant to be a step by step guide through the features of the Rust programming language.  Rust is often considered a language with a steep learning curve, but I hope I can convince you there's a lot to explore before we even get to complex parts.

    You can also find this guide in these languages:

    You can navigate through the tour with keyboard <span class="emoji">⬅️</span> and <span class="emoji">➡️</span>.
